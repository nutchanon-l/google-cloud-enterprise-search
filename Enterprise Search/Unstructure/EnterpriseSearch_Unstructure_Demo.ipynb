One study participant explained: \\u201cOne huge benefit of\\nCloud SQL is the overall clarity on how much the infrastructure costs. With Google, you have a\\nclear idea on that piece of information so you can plan accordingly .... .Another huge business\\nimpact is that if we need to expand rapidly, we are not blocked.\\u201d On average, study participants\\nreported that they spend 12% less to run equivalent databases with Cloud SQL\\u2009\\u2014\\u2009that is, 12%\\nreduction from $8,200 to $7,200 per database over three years (see Figure 4).\\nDirect database cost savings and staff time efficiencies combine to create a strong value\\nproposition for Cloud SQL from a total cost of operations perspective. One study participant\\ndescribed the need to consider overall costs, rather than fixating on annual subscription fees,\\nto understand the scale of such cost efficiencies: \\u201cIf you compare the most obvious cost, yes,\\nCloud SQL is more expensive. In my opinion, you can only come to that conclusion if you close\\nyour eyes on other hidden costs that are more significant. Then it flips the situation in favor of\\nCloud SQL because you have to account for things like database backups and the underlying\\nscalability of the hardware.\\u201d Another interviewed organization explained how it relies on\\nGoogle-provided managed services to ensure cost-effective and high-performing relational\\ndatabases: \\u201cWe basically have no chance to provide the same level of service as\\nCloud SQL .... . There is a lot of complex engineering behind the scenes happening on the\\nGoogle side, so it makes sense for us to just benefit from it rather than put ourselves in a\\ncompetition against much bigger engineering teams.\\u201d\\nFigure 4 confirms the overall cost efficiencies for study participants of using fully managed Cloud\\nSQL as opposed to managing their own databases in an on-premises environment.\\nIDC calculates that they will lower costs over three years by an average of 28%, saving\\n$4,500 per database, even as they achieve significant and valuable gains in database agility,\\nperformance, and reliability as discussed elsewhere in this study.\\nAcross hundreds or even thousands of databases, these cost efficiencies add up to substantial\\nsavings, thereby allowing organizations to reduce the overall cost of running databases key to\\ntheir business operations and potentially invest cost and staff time savings into other initiatives\\nand business activities (see Figure 4, next page).\"\n","      }\n","    ]\n","  },\n","  {\n","    \"name\": \"projects/939158786986/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/nutchanon-google-databases_1687922379274/branches/0/documents/010\",\n","    \"id\": \"010\",\n","    \"link\": \"gs://nutchanon-genapp-storage-01/databases-pdfs/microservices_on_cloudsql_whitepaper.pdf\",\n","    \"extractive_segments\": [\n","      {\n","        \"content\": \"Database - Each microservice is deployed in a separate database within the same instance\\nMicroservices in this architecture can share a Cloud SQL instance but are deployed within a single isolated\\ndatabase.

Maintaining them can be difficult, expensive,\\nand fraught with the risk of human error. Operating them at peak efficiency requires expertise\\nand also the immediate availability of system resources, including servers and storage, needed\\nto ensure smooth performance and continuous availability. Most businesses that maintain\\nsuch systems are not in the database business; they are in banking, or retail, or healthcare,\\nor manufacturing, or logistics, or some other industry that is not directly related to database\\nmanagement but depends on the immediate and reliable availability of the data that drives\\nthe business.\\nThe public cloud offers an environment in which compute and storage resources are readily\\navailable. A public cloud service provides automation at scale and employs database\\nprofessionals to perform secondary tasks, and it also can apply software patches, maintain\\nthe hardware, perform backups, and tune the database for maximum performance and\\nreliability\\u2009\\u2014\\u2009all without involving any effort on the part of the staff of a client enterprise.\\nCloud SQL is such a service.\\n\\nCloud SQL\\n\\nGoogle is one of the premier providers of public cloud services in the world, in the form of\\nGoogle Cloud. Among the many services that Google Cloud offers is Cloud SQL, which can\\ndeploy and manage database servers on behalf of subscription customers. This service includes\\nall maintenance activities, as well as database tuning and optimization. Google offers this service\\nin support of MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. Since MySQL and PostgreSQL are open\\nsource, the client pays only for the Google service. In the case of Microsoft SQL Server, the\\nlicense is embedded in the fee.\\nIn addition to providing a platform for the client\\u2019s database, Google Cloud offers integration with\\nother Google data services such as BigQuery, a data warehouse, and enables clients to leverage\\nthe data in App Engine, Google Compute Engine, and Google Kubernetes Engine, as they\\nmodernize their applications. Google Cloud also offers a migration service for moving data from\\nthe on-premises environment to Cloud SQL using a database migration service (DMS).\"\n","      }\n","    ]\n","  },\n","  {\n","    \"name\": \"projects/939158786986/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/nutchanon-google-databases_1687922379274/branches/0/documents/010\",\n","    \"id\": \"010\",\n","    \"link\": \"gs://nutchanon-genapp-storage-01/databases-pdfs/microservices_on_cloudsql_whitepaper.pdf\",\n","    \"extractive_answers\": [\n","      {\n","        \"pageNumber\": \"17\",\n","        \"content\": \"Database - Each microservice is deployed in a separate database within the same instance Microservices in this architecture can share a Cloud SQL instance but are deployed within a single isolated database.

For example, if a team wants to deploy something that requires database infrastructure, we don't need to even discuss what sort of workload is\\nanticipated. . .\\nIt\\u2019s basically not only that you're able to do certain things, but you're also able to simply save time on the conversations that no longer need\\nto be had. That's quite substantial in its own right.\\u201d\\n\\n4\\n\\nMore timely and predictable development capabilities: \\u201cGoogle Cloud SQL has allowed our developers to own and operationalize their entire stacks\\nin a way that is repeatable. One of our main focuses has been how long does it take to go from, \\u2018I want to develop a new app,\\u2019 to it running in production. .\\n\\n.\\n\\nWe want developers to be able to do quickly when they need to create applications. What Google Cloud SQL has done for us has been a huge\\ncomponent in that these teams no longer have to build into their application time reliance on another team that is unknown. So it's allowed them to make\\nmore accurate predictions that they can report back to their product owner.\\u201d\\n\\n5\"\n","      }\n","    ]\n","  }\n","]\n","Summary: Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses for its end-user products, such as Google Search and YouTube.
